        <h1>Happy Birthday Bhaiya!</h1>
        <p>
         Happy Birthday, Anas Bhaiya! I am truly grateful to have a brother like you. 
         To be honest, I wanted to give you a greeting card or a handmade gift, but I couldn't, so I made this instead.
        I know it’s quite basic, but I created it with the HTML and CSS I know and with a little help from ChatGPT. 
        I hope you like it.I want you to know  the things that I can’t say to your face.Throughout my life, you have always been there to support me. 
        No matter the situation, you've stood by me. I know you care deeply about your loved ones, though you rarely show it. 
        I want you to know that I respect you not just as a sibling but also as a friend and mentor.
        Life has been challenging for you, and you've grown from these experiences. 
        The responsibilities you've managed are beyond what I could handle. 
        There’s so much I want to express, but I don't have the words.
        I want you to know that  you are the best brother any sister could have.
         In the future, I hope for a relationship that’s more than just the typical sibling relationship. 
         I don't want to fight with you over meaningless topics. 
         If I ever do something that hurts you, please let me know. 
         Have a wonderful and amazing birthday. When you get back home, I'll make sure to bake a cake and cook some biryani for you.
        </p>
